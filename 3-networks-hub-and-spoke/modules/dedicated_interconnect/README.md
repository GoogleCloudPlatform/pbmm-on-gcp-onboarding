# Dedicated Interconnect module

This module implements the recommendation proposed in [Establishing 99.99% Availability for Dedicated Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/tutorials/dedicated-creating-9999-availability).

## Prerequisites

1. Provisioning of four [Dedicated Interconnect connections](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/dedicated-overview) in the `prj-interconnect` project created in step `1-org` under folder `fldr-common`.

## Usage

1. Rename `interconnect.tf.example` to `interconnect.tf` in the shared envs folder in `3-networks-hub-and-spoke/envs/shared`
1. Rename `interconnect.auto.tfvars.example` to `interconnect.auto.tfvars` in the shared envs folder in `3-networks-hub-and-spoke/envs/shared`
1. Update the file `interconnect.tf` with values that are valid for your environment for the interconnects, locations, candidate subnetworks, vlan_tag8021q and peer info.
1. The candidate subnetworks and vlan_tag8021q variables can be set to `null` to allow the interconnect module to auto generate these values.
