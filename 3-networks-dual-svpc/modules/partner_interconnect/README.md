# Partner Interconnect module

This module implements the recommendation proposed in [Establishing 99.99% Availability for Partner Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/tutorials/partner-creating-9999-availability).

## Prerequisites

1. Provisioning of four [VLAN attachments](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/partner-overview) in the Hub project in the specified environment. That would be the `prj-{p|n|d}-shared-{base|restricted}` under corresponding environment's folder and `prj-c-dns-hub` under the folder `fldr-common`.

## Usage

1. Rename `partner_interconnect.tf.example` to `partner_interconnect.tf` in the shared envs folder in `3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/shared`
1. Rename `partner_interconnect.auto.tfvars.example` to `partner_interconnect.auto.tfvars` in the shared envs folder in `3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/shared`
1. Update the file `interconnect.tf` with values that are valid for your environment for the interconnects, locations, candidate subnetworks, vlan_tag8021q and peer info.
1. Rename `partner_interconnect.tf.example` to `partner_interconnect.tf` in the base-env folder in `3-networks-dual-svpc/modules/base_env` .
1. Update the `enable_partner_interconnect` to `true` in each `main.tf` file in the environment folder in `3-networks-dual-svpc/envs/<environment>` .
1. Update the file `partner_interconnect.tf` with values that are valid for your environment for the VLAN attachments, locations.
