# 3-networks-dual-svpc/non-production

The purpose of this step is to set up base and restricted shared VPCs with default DNS, NAT (optional), Private Service networking, VPC service controls, onprem Dedicated Interconnect, onprem VPN and baseline firewall rules for environment non-production.

| perimeter\_additional\_members | The list of additional members to be added to the perimeter access level members list. To be able to see the resources protected by the VPC Service Controls in the restricted perimeter, add your user in this list.
