## Design

### Naming Standard
- see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/132
- see also SSC tagging/naming standard reference
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/182
- Follow https://cloud.google.com/architecture/best-practices-vpc-design#naming

#### Discussion
The current naming standard in the PBMM LZ uses a slightly modified version of the original CDK at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/tree/main/modules/naming-standard

As you can see in the LZ we have distributed the keys among the environment tfvars in common, bootstrap and prod/non-prod. In particular each of the VPC's, subnets, log sinks have customized local names - not every name is generated from a central API.

We will need to add 30 char validation - it would be ideal if this validation was part of name generation and not a hard stop warning during terraform plan/apply.

We have multiple optional dept/domain/org id;s throughout
(org)-(domain)-(env = prod/stg..)-vpc
using domain cloudnuage.dev
cpde-cnd-audit-cne
cnpe-cnd-prd-perim

Discuss required vs optional and additions such as region/dept
Discuss multi- organization option


### Backups
Trusted image policies can be setup using organization policies in IAM - see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/restricting-image-access
GCP services configurations and snapshots can be configured for scheduled automated snapshots to Google Cloud Storage using four tiers of short to long term storage.

Notes:
define a naming standard and schedule for automated snapshots 

### Configuration Management
All services, roles and artifacts inside the GCP organization are tracked in IAM Asset Inventory and Security Command Center - both change tracking.

### Logging
[Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs) (part of the [Cloud Operations Suite](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations)) has its own dashboard.
The logging agent (ops - based on FluentD / OpenTelemetry) is on each VM - out of the box it captures OS logs (and optionally - application logs - which is configurable in the agent).  Log sources include service, vm, vpc flow and firewall logs.

#### Log Sinks
Google Cloud Logs can be routed using log sinks (with optional aggregation) to destinations like Cloud Storage (object storage), PubSub (message queue) or BigQuery (serverless data warehouse) with 4 levels of tiering for long term storage or auditing.

#### Audit Logging Policy
GCP provides for audit logging of admin, data access, system event and policy denied logs for the following [services](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/services) - in addition to [access transparency logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/available-logs). Redacted user info is included in the audit log entries.  

### Network Zoning
Ref: ITSG-22: https://cyber.gc.ca/sites/default/files/cyber/publications/itsp80022-e.pdf - see ZIP (Zone Interface Points)
Ref: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones

  The GCP PBMM Landing Zone architecture provides an automated and pluggable framework to help secure enterprise workloads using a governance model for services and cost distribution.

  The network zoning architecture is implemented via virtual SDN (software defined networking) in GCP via the [Andromeda framework](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/google-cloud-networking-in-depth-how-andromeda-2-2-enables-high-throughput-vms).  Physical and virtual zoning between the different network zones is the responsibility of GCP.  The physical networking and hosting infrastructure within and between the two canadian regions is the responsibility of GCP as per [PE-3](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/blob/main/docs/google-cloud-security-controls.md#3830pe-3physical-access-control)

  This PBMM architecture supports all the common network level security controls that would be expected within a zoned network around routing, firewall rules and access control.  The GCP PBMM Landing Zone will support the ITSG-22 Baseline Security Requirements for Network Security Controls.  Information flow is controlled between each network segment/zone via VPC networks, VPC Service Controls, Shared VPCs or VPC Peering for network connections.  The network design currently includes a PAZ/Perimeter public access zone/VPC, a management zone on the perimeter, an internal production zone in either shared VPC for PaaS workloads or Peered VPC for IaaS workloads.  As part of the PAZ/Perimeter zone we deploy a Fortigate cluster between a front facing L7 public load balancer and an internal L7 private load balancer.  All messaging traverses the PAZ where the Fortigate cluster packet inspects ingress and egress traffic.  GCP deploys Cloud Armor in front of the PAZ zone for additional default protection in the form of ML based L7 DDoS attack mitigation, OWASP top 10, LB attacks and Bot management via reCAPTCHA  
  
  All ingress traffic traverses the perimeter public facing Layer 7 Load Balancer and firewall configured in the Perimeter project/VPC.  All egress internet traffic is packet inspected as it traverses the Firewall Appliance cluster in the perimeter VPC. All internal traffic inside the GCP network is default encrypted at the L3/L4 level. Public IP’s cannot be deployed in the client/workload VPC’s due to deny setting in the “Define allowed external IPs for VM instances” IAM Organization Policy.  Public IP's are only permitted specifically in the public perimeter VPC hosting the public facing L7 Load Balancer in front of the Firewall Appliance cluster. 
  All network operations are centrally managed by the customer operations team on a least privilege model - using the GCP Cloud Operations Suite in concert with IAM accounts and roles.
  Logging and network event monitoring are provided by the centralized GCP Logging Service and associated Log Agents.


### Vulnerability Management
#### Container Analysis

Static analysis of container images is provided by [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/analysis) | Container Analysis and Vulnerability Scanning - including automatic [Vulnerability Scanning](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/docs/os-overview) (per container image build)  

#### Cloud Armor
Proactive threat detection also occurs at the perimeter of customer networks via Cloud Armor https://cloud.google.com/armor.  Google Cloud Armor provides DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) and WAF (Web Application Firewall) protection in addition to Bot, OWASP and adaptive ML based layer 7 DDoS capabilities.   Cloud Armor integrates with our Cloud CDN and Apigee API Management front end services.  Detection can be customized by adding rules - the following is in place by default
- ML based layer 7 DDoS attacks
- OWASP top 10 for hybrid
- Load Balancer attacks
- Bot management via reCAPTCHA 

GCP Compute and GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) benefit from secure [Shielded VMs](https://cloud.google.com/shielded-vm)

#### Intrusion Detection System
GCP IDS (Intrusion Detection System Service) (based on the Palo Alto security appliance) - https://cloud.google.com/intrusion-detection-system handles Malware, Spyware and Command-and-Control attacks. Intra- and inter-VPC communication is monitored. Network-based threat data for threat investigation and correlation can be generated including intrusion tracking and response.

In addition for Chrome based clients we have BeyondCorp zero trust capabilities.

#### Security Command Center
Security Command Center Premium includes Vulnerability scanning, Findings, Container Threat Detection, Event Threat Detection, Virtual Machine Threat Detection, Web Security Scanner - application discovery/scanning
Security Command Center Premium - Threat Detection - https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-event-threat-detection-overview detects threats using logs running in Google Cloud at scale including container attacks involving suspicious binary, suspicious library, and reverse shell vectors.

GCP provides trusted image scanning to reject unsanctioned public image downloads through a organizational policy called trusted image policy https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/restricting-image-access 



## Design Issues
The design of the landing zone follows GCP best practices and architecture principles detailed in the following references.

- https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones
- https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework
- 
### DI 0: GCP Secure Landing Zones - Best Practices

### DI 1: Decide on Shared VPC or Hub-and-spoke Network Topologies
- see VPC network design in the KCC Landing Zone Architecture discussion - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit/blob/dev/solutions/landing-zone/architecture.md#di-05-complete-network-design
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/146

The requirements of the landing zone involve a managed IP space and use of L7 packet inspection - which leans more towards use of Shared VPC's for each dev/stg/uat/prod environment.   See decision references in https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones/decide-network-design

https://cloud.google.com/architecture/best-practices-vpc-design#multi-nic

### DI 2: Multi Organization and/or Folder Resource separation for dev/prod Multitenant Environments

Add isssue on shared/peered VPCs
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/164 
Requirements

- 1: Shared VPC (with service projects) - PaaS + shared FaaS
- all tenants share a shared VPC host subnet
- some tenants share a particular shared VPC host subnet
- single tenants get their own 1:1 shared VPC host subnet
- 2: Mix Shared VPC + Peered VPCs
- some tenants have a mix of shared
- 3: Peered VPCs (single tenant PaaS, IaaS, FaaS)
- some tenants want their own distinct VPC with their own servless VPC endpoints

### DI 3: Network Traffic Flows
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/149

Table with details on all possible flows in and out of the GCP Landing Zone.
Flow ID | Direction | Source | Location | Target | Protocols | Notes | Code/Evidence
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
 1 | in | public | CA | public LB | https | with/without IP inspection appliance | 
 
### DI 4: Cloud Identity Federation
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/99

See Identity Onboarding and Federation options at https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones/decide-how-to-onboard-identities
- using Option 2  
- using https://cloud.google.com/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory
- https://cloud.google.com/architecture/identity/reference-architectures#using_an_external_idp

### DI 5: IaaS/PaaS/SaaS Application Security
Determine list of services to help enable applicaton security firewalls, vulnerability, OS protections.  SCC Threat detection handles what is going on inside the IaaS/PaaS systems where Armor/IDS handle ingress/egress traffic and Shielded VMs handle IaaS.

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/158

### DI 6: Landing Zone Network Topology Design
- Reference: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones/decide-network-design#option-2
- We will be focusing on option 2 - a network topology with a mix of shared VPCs and Hub-and-scope network peering that involve Firewall Appliances
- see Fortigate design in https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/45

Going through GC-CAP, GC-TIP architecture as part of SCED/SC2G https://gc-cloud-services.canada.ca/s/article/What-is-Secure-Cloud-Enablement-and-Defense-SCED-EN?language=en_US

I recommend we deploy 2 sets of 2-VM fortigate clusters - for pbmm GoC/DC C2G GC-TIP and public GC-CAP

## Work Items
