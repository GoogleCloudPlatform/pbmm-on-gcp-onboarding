# Upgrade Guidance

## Integrating New Features

There is no direct path for upgrading from v3 to v4 as this may result in resources getting deleted or recreated.

In case you require to integrate some of the v4's features, we recommend to review the documentation regarding the feature you are interested in and use v4's code as a guidance for its implementation. We also recommend to review the output from `terraform plan` for any destructive operations before applying the updates.

**Note:** You must verify that you are using the correct version for `terraform` and `gcloud`.
You can check these and other additional requirements using this [validate script](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/blob/master/scripts/validate-requirements.sh).
