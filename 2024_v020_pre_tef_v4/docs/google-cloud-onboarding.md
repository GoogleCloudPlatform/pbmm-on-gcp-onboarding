# References

Creation of a GCP Organization including either a Workspace or Cloud Identity account - https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization.  If projects and their billing ID association are created before a domain and organization are added - these projects can be migrated via https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/migrating-projects-billing


# New Google Cloud Account Prerequisites

Note: this document is for initial Cloud Identity - Super Admin accounts. For production deployments, usually identity federation will be used.  See Identity Onboarding and Federation options at https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones/decide-how-to-onboard-identities

When creating a new google cloud account the following artifacts will be required.

- One or more existing billing account IDs or access to a credit card that will be associated with a new billing account
- An existing or new email for use as the "Primary Admin" in https://admin.google.com/ac/accountsettings and as the "Super Admin" role in https://admin.google.com/ac/roles/53389702564151297
- An existing or new domain for organization DNS validation

There is a special IAM role that will need to be added to both any new super admin level users beyond the original SA root account and any service accounts used during automated deployments involving new projects that require associated billing permissions to link a billing account to projects.  In addition to the "Project Billing Manager" we need to set the "Billing Account Administrator"

In the following screen capture - this is a new GCP account where the "root" account was automatically added to the billing permission side in billing : https://console.cloud.google.com/billing. Any additional admin users are added automatically to the billing side if they are added in IAM.  Notice that the root account is not set in IAM but is set in billing.

# Google Cloud Account post-onboarding Guardrails or Landing Zone deployment

After your organization has been created, we recommend that one of the following guardrails or landing zone deployments depending on the security profile of your projects and/or organization

## Google Cloud Guardrails and Landing Zone options

**https://github.com/canada-ca/accelerators_accelerateurs-gcp - 30 day Guardrails**

**https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding - PBMM landing zone**

Determining which set of guardrails or landing zone to use will depend on your cloud profile use case https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails/blob/master/EN/00_Applicable-Scope.md#cloud-usage-profiles (Level 1 for private only sandboxes all the way to Level 6 for PBMM (Protected B Medium Integrity / Medium Availability - with or without SCED/SC2G - see slide 18-19 of https://wiki.gccollab.ca/images/7/75/GC_Cloud_Connection_Patterns.pdf)

We recommend either the 30 day Guardrails https://github.com/canada-ca/accelerators_accelerateurs-gcp or the full PBMM landing zone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding for profile 1 to 2 or prototyping work.  We recommend the full PBMM landing zone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding for profile 2 to 6.

**Important**: Check your email inbox and respond to the email asking you to verify your contact information. This is required by ICANN (the governing body for domain registration) to complete domain registration. After you purchase a domain, you'll receive an email to verify your email address. You must verify your email address within 15 days. Otherwise, your domain won't be registered and you can't use it for email and other services.

### Quota Increase

By default, a Billing Account can only be linked to a certain number of projects, based on a variety of factors. A temporary workaround is to create additional billing accounts to get quota per account - or associate an existing billing account from another organization - see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/blob/main/docs/google-cloud-onboarding.md#onboarding-category-3b1-3rd-party-email-account---3rd-party-aws-route53-domain-validation---reuse-existing-billing-account

#### Billing Quota
- default 5 per billing account - add 10-20 at a time
https://support.google.com/code/contact/billing_quota_increase

#### Project Quota
- default 50 per organization - add 20-50 at a time
https://support.google.com/code/contact/project_quota_increase

To submit a quota increase follow the next steps:
* try to ask for under 50 at a time - as 50 is the verification point where the automated approval may not kick in - try for 20-30
* Fill out the billing quota increase from the default 5 directly via https://support.google.com/code/contact/billing_quota_increase
* or
* Create (at least) 5 projects, or more, under the folder created in the GCP validation steps section.
* On the left menu, go to Billing and select âMy Projectsâ. Notice that the last project has billing disabled.
* In the Actions column, click the "More Actions" (3 dots) icon corresponding to the project. Select âChange Billingâ.

### Increasing Quotas
Ask for 20 from the default 5 for project/billing association - create 6 projects and assign billing on the 6th to get the popup.
Select "paid services" and you will get approved in 3 min in most cases.
For example

Fill out the form - note the paid services and less than 50 request

Usually you get 2 emails - the request and the response - lately we recieve just the response for billing/quota within 3 min.  This is on an account that has been on past the 90 day credit period and with previously approved requests

## Cloud Identity License Increases
By default your organization receives 50 licences for Cloud Identity Free edition.  This will increase to 100 if you purchase services like Google Workspaces.  If you require more than 50 or 100 licences and/or are prototype identity federation you can request more licenses by filling out the following form from your admin console.

## Onboarding Category 1b: Workspace Account -Â  Domain hosted by 3rd Party

## Onboarding Category 2: 3rd party Email -Â  GCP Domain

This category is where the client uses their own email system but has the organization domain with GCP

## Onboarding Category 3: Gmail Account -Â  Domain hosted on Google Domains


Creation of a GCP Organization including either a Workspace or Cloud Identity account - https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization.  If projects and their billing ID association are created before a domain and organization are added - these projects can be migrated via https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/migrating-projects-billing

Follow the next steps if:
* You are a new customer using a Gmail account with optional redirect records on an existing Google Domains hosted domain for your organization.

This scenario will guide you through the steps to create a required Cloud Identity account (using a Gmail account) and a subdomain for an existing Google Domains managed domain. 

In this scenario the Gmail account is a formality. You can also use your own 3rd party email account.

Perform the following steps in an Incognito Window.

To create a Cloud Identity account follow these steps:
* Go to https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail.
* Enter the information required.
* Select âCreate a new Gmail address insteadâ.

## Onboarding Category 3b1: 3rd party email account - 3rd party (AWS Route53) domain validation - reuse existing billing account

There are several ways to add a shared billing account - email push/pull - but the 3rd - just adding the identity user in the 2nd organization as a Billing Administrator in the organization owning the billing id works ok.  
This method also reproduces the state we see where the shared billing id shows up only under âno organization : id=0â but is automatically added to new projects in the target org ok.  

So we have a way to simulate the billing provisioning using 2 separate organizations.

- 20220802
- follow https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/set-up-cloud-identity-admin and select Cloud Identity Free https://workspace.google.com/signup/gcpidentity/welcome#0
- In this case we wish to use a pre-existing billing account

### Requirements
- 3 personas required
- - Cloud Identity user (a super admin (usually the first user of the target account) - the user that will onboard the organization via https://workspace.google.com/signup/gcpidentity/welcome#0
- - Billing Account Administrator (source account) - the user who will add the account name (identity email) of the super admin of the target account above
- - Owner of the domain zone (to be able to apply the domain verification TXT record during organization onboarding by the target super admin above)
- 
- The Super Admin of the target account must have access to the Domain zone (even if it is sending a mail to the IT/Domain-zone owner) - to be able to set the organization subdomain TXT record for domain validation
- Billing account admin of the owning billing account must set the target Identity account as the Billing Account Administrator (full landing zone rights) - or Billing User, Billing Viewer (for single projects)

### Procedure
- create/use new 3rd party email account matching at least the TLD - in this case an AWS Workmail account under eventstream.io
- create new Cloud Identity account - user@gcp.eventstream.io with domain gcp.eventstream.io - specifically via https://workspace.google.com/signup/gcpidentity/welcome#0
- validate domain via TXT record on AWS route 53
- login to the cloud console at console.cloud.google.com
- request to move billing accounts in IAM or add the target user as a billing admin in the source/owner organization

### 3b1 - domain validation via TXT record
- Note we are creating a TXT record with the key set to the organization name (not related to an A or CNAME record against later workload FQDN or IP addresses)
- Note we are **not** creating a new domain as detailed in the process https://gc-cloud-services.canada.ca/s/dns-ground-to-public-article?language=en_US - only adding a TXT record to validate ownership
- 30-120 seconds for DNS propagation then the dialog should continue.

- Note: the billing adminstrator role must be added to the target cloud identity account by the owner of the billing id - this is done in the "manage billing" section of billing - separate from adding the role in IAM.

## Onboarding Category 5: 3rd party Email - 3rd party Domain

This category is common for organizations new to GCP or multicloud where both the email system and DNS hosting zone are 3rd party

See the similar section [Onboarding Catagory 3 - GCP hosted domains](#onboarding-category-3-gmail-account---domain-hosted-on-google-domains)

### Category 5a: First 3rd party Email - 3rd party Domain requires TXT verification

### Category 5b: First 3rd party Email - 3rd party Domain requires indirect verification
Usually copy/paste or email


### Category 5c: second 3rd party Email - 3rd party Domain already verified
- using the original super admin/owner create another cloud identity account with an email on the organization domain - with optional email forward to their work email.  Give rights such as "Owner" or "Folder Admin" to this 2nd+ user, when they login to console.cloud.google.com they will already have proper access to the organization (no domain validation required)

goto the admin page at admin.google.com

This category is common for individual consumers where they do not have a gmail account or any domain.Â  This option will not have an organization top node in IAM

## Onboarding Category 9: GmailÂ  Email or Google Account on 3rd party email or proxy - no Domain - no Organization

This category is common for individual consumers where they gmail account but no domain, or a 3rd party domain where they have an email or proxy but do not wish to setup or validate a domain.Â  This option will not have an organization top node in IAM.

With a Google Account only - you can still collaborate across separate Google Accounts in GCP by sharing resources via IAM.

All the organization policies are still available at the project level.

Later you may migrate these NO ORGANIZATION project into the organization created at a later date via https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/project-migration

Procedure:

create google account on existing email address - can also be a domain email proxy
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en

# Onboarding to Google Cloud using a cloud identity account
## Google Cloud Identity

Google Cloud Identity accounts are ideal for cloud account organizations where the user identities are maintained outside of Google cloud in for example AWS Workmail or Azure Active Directory.

## Planning

Create or gain access to the domain you wish to associate or federate users from.Â  For example packet.global.

You will need access to the domain zone to add TXT records for domain validation under a subdomain like gcp.packet.global

Open Chrome Window with no Google Account

# Category 10: Workaround for DENY flagged domain during Cloud Identity creation

During testing for the following section https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/blob/main/docs/google-cloud-onboarding.md#onboarding-category-3b1-3rd-party-email-account---3rd-party-aws-route53-domain-validation---reuse-existing-billing-account

On occasion you will get the following DENY https://workspace.google.com/signup/gcpidentity/deny on creating a cloud identity user during organization onboarding using the procedure in https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/set-up-cloud-identity-admin if you repeatedly use the same cloud identity creation process for the same domain

The primary workaround is to contact your FSR or CE and/or support to get your domain on an allowlist.  The SLO for this is usually under 24 hours.

The secondary workaround is to use a separate TLD domain and subdomain for now.  The full workaround is TBD (time based, Google Support unflag...TBD).
The fact that the dialog states that your computer may be compromised is very likely not the issue as I have registered another cloud identity account right after on the same machine/browser.  The issue looks to be domain related on domains new to google cloud that have had several attempts at creating a cloud identity account on the same domain.

I retested this particular domain for timing and using a different email, subdomain and also look for a workaround and/or support fix - will try different computer/5G location for the flagged domain.

After the domain allowlist entry - Cloud Identity onboarding proceeded OK.

# Category 11: Onboarding without access to the domain zone - variant use case
- 20220809: TBD - document any procedure to create an organization without access to the actual domain - where TXT record submission to the zone is not possible.  I would expectd that this is variant use case and could be used to add subdomain to a domain the client does not own - hence private zone access only in this case.  However there are cases where the user has not yet gained access to the domain zone in their org and wishes to create/validate the domain for a new organization before actuall domain validation can be done.


# Onboarding 12: New Cloud Identity users are flagged as User Suspended by default in admin security alert center - ignore - this is a red-herring
- 20220902: We will get to the root cause and determine the criteria for default suspension when creating a new org or importing identity users - for now you can ignore or reset the suspension (note: we need to know when the suspension is real)
- For example this org was onboarded from scratch and the super admin idenity user was already flagged as "User Suspended" - with no effects.

## Billing Summary

- Type 1: shared billing account where account owner in other org adds the super admin account in this org as a Billing Account Administrator and/or Billing Account User where normal [IAM inheritance into Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access) is not done due to security separation.  In this case the target service account must have a copy of it's Billing Account User role also set on the billing page under the org "NONE SELECTED".
- Type 2: direct billing credit card on this account (all tests above so far are this case)
State of billing id associations for type 2 are the following (this one is for the guardrails install https://github.com/canada-ca/accelerators_accelerateurs-gcp/issues/47) - notice that the terraform service account is in the list as well as the user super admin account.

### Shared Billing Accounts

<img width="908" alt="_gcp_shared_billing_use_cases" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94715080/192614537-c5c144e0-9834-402f-9755-3d22d00cc888.png">


TL;DR; Shared billing accounts do not get shared IAM roles - they need to be set separately

We need a workaround (see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/issues/177 ) for the fact that if the billing account is of type "shared" - owned by a source organization where it comes in under the target organization as "Non Selected, ID=0" then any service account created will not get inherited links from IAM set in Billing - these like Billing Account User - need to be set manually.  The workaround is currently manual - set the billing role directy in Billing on the shared account.
See IAM Role inheritance into Billing Roles in https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access


Example 
```
michael@cloudshell:~$ gcloud config set project gcp-zone-landing-stg

Set the billing role
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ${ORG_ID}  --member=serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL} --role=roles/billing.user

check again

michael@cloudshell:~ (gcp-zone-landing-stg)$ gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ${ORG_ID}  --member=serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL} --role=roles/billing.user
Updated IAM policy for organization [925207728429].

## Change Organization associated with a Billing Account ID - optional non-shared use case
For most cases we do not modify the original owning organization on a particular billing account.  When we want to distributed this BID (billing ID) to other organizations in the form of project/billing associations - we do this via the Cloud Identity roles "Billing Account Administrator" - which can also assign "Billing Account User" roles to service accounts or just "Billing Account User".  The identity user or SA in the receiving org can then switch projects to this shared billling account.


However there is a way to move a billing account (not recommended for cloud brokerage shared billing client organizations).
When the organization admin role is assigned in the BID owning org to the organization admins / billing account admins in the target or sub-orgs (remember all organizations are flat - but they can appear as sub-orgs via subdomains).

In the "Billing Account Management" view - select "Change Organization" and select one of the sub-orgs like below

Moving the billing account between organizations is usually reserved for full organization migration.

# GCP Account Shutdown Scenarios
- Note: billing accounts and shared billing accounts cannot be deleted - they can be removed from an org by removing the "Billing Account Administrator" role for other organization super admins (not the current owned billing project for this org)
- see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/blob/main/docs/google-cloud-onboarding.md#shared-billing-accounts
- Summary: delete the project to ensure resources are shutdown
- Disabling billing will remove billable
- 
## GCP Project Deletion
There are 4 scenarios to start
   1 - project(s) deletion - https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#shutting_down_projects
   2 - project migration to another organization - https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/project-migration and https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/moving-projects-folders
   3 - project backup/restore (at the GCP service level using GCE snapshot for example, or if the services were raised using gcloud/terraform/kcc deployment scripts)
   4 - disassociate billing on the project

### Project Initial State
- two organizations (gcp.zone - org with the project to be deleted) and (landing.gcp.zone - org owning the shared billing account)
- Shared billing account from landing.gcp.zone to gcp.zone org via Billing Account Administrator role

### Project Deletion
- notice that project clouddeploy-gz is assocated with the billing account 0127C1-...-EA25D6 from another org - the goal is to shutdown completely the project and disassociate billing so no more charges occur
- We navigate to the project in the owning organization and delete the project - starting a 30day cycle where it can be reactivated
- follow https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#shutting_down_projects
- Quote "If the project has a billing account associated with it, that association is broken, and isn't reinstated if the project delete operation is canceled. After 30 days, the project is fully deleted."

- in my case I have 2 projects that are billing under 0.01 per day with a cumulation of .23 and .21 = .44 - with 13% tax up to .49 - not all services are regional so if the buckets are in NA they will be taxed.  Anyway I will determine which resources are having resdidual - likely cloud storage bucket costs.

## Disabled Billing and Free Services
Note: Deleted projects are recoverable up to 30 days from "pending deletion" state - after that they are fully deleted from backup.Â  Â billing-disabled/unset projects stay in IAM and have active free resources (such as an IAM service account) | Manage Resources - and are visible in /billing/projects indefinitely (IE: I have non-empty billing disabled projects from 2014 in one of my orgs)
Therefore I recommend projects be in "Deleted" not "Disable Billing" state - unless you want to reenable them after 30 days.

For example an older billing disabled project

The project below has been in billing disabled state since 2014

I do however have a left over Google App Engine application (from an Eclipse in-IDE deployment) left over from 2019 that is created but not deployed - hence no billing account required yet.

# GCP Organization Deletion
This section details procedures around deleting one or more organizations.  The use case around org deletion is usually in the context of semi-automated sub-org creation/deletion as teams iterate in and out of project level GCP deployments in a multi-org multi-tenant landing zone structure.

Note:
- billing data is on a 24h refresh cycle

## References
- Deleting an organization resource [https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#deleting_an_organization_resource )
- Delete your organization's Google Account https://support.google.com/a/answer/9468554?hl=en
## Example Organization Deletion
There are two organizations involved in this use case - the org under deletion gcp...network and the org holding the billing id gcp...network.

We will need to delete the super admin reference to the org under deletion that may still may be associated as a billing account administrator on the organization holding the billing account this is step 2 in the "[creating-managing-organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#deleting_an_organization_resource )" section

### Scenario 1: 
- historical billing - org still up - org BAA still associated (normal scenario)
- historical billing - org still up - org BAA unassociated more than 24h ago
- historical billing - org deleted more than 24h ago - org BAA still associated
- historical billing - org deleted more than 24h ago - org BAA unassociated more than 24h ago

Scenario: we will delete the organization gcp...network after at least 24h of billing association with the owning org approach...zone

#### 20230103:1000 org deletion started
Following https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#deleting_an_organization_resource
- OA_ORG_D: Organization Administrator account (and Workspace super admin) - ad-s@gc*.g*.n*
- ORG_D: Organization to delete = gcp.*.network
- BID_1: Organization owning BID 1 = app*.gcp.z*
- BID_2: Organization owning BID 2 = gcp.z*

##### Current State
- The org admin OA_ORG_D for ORG_D is currently associated as a BAA under BID_1 and BID_2
- 

##### Actions
- delete 3 remaining projects including 2 stopped GCE VMs on ORG_D
- Note: billing should be disabled first - if not goto billing | account managment - disable billing on deleted projects
- dev-* with BID_1 app*
- gcloud-* with BID_2 gcp*
- (optionally disassociate OA_ORD_D from BID_1 and BID_2 - if you have BAA access to these other organizations
- verify no projects in billing | my projects
- verify single billing account directly under the org in billing
- verify 3 billing accounts under the org "none selected"
- delete all subscriptions except (cloud identity)
- follow https://support.google.com/a/answer/9468554?hl=en
- navigate to Account | Account settings | Account Management | Delete Account

Check account

- attempting to login = "This account was recently deleted and may be recoverable. Click Next to attempt to restore this account."

##### Verify Deleted Account
- check shared billing at BID_1 and notice the BAA association now appends the following to the deleted account "**uid=5034....247802**"
- We will wait 24h to verify whether billing history stays up and also verify whether the BAA assocation deletion has an effect on billing history (deletes historical records) - by removing the BAA only from BAA_2
- To verify whether the GCP super admin gcloud/cloud-identity account has been deleted - check role associations in https://console.cloud.google.com in any other organization linked to the account and look for a ?uid=.... appended to the email
- Before

- After

##### Remove Billing ID association for one of the orgs
- on g*.z* removing billing association on a deleted project
- removing the BAA role on the deleted account
- in 24h check historical billing still shows for this deleted account

## Shared Billing considerations during Organization Deletion
In the shared billing account owning organization you will continue to see historical billing metrics around any projects, folders and the organization itself after deletion.

- see historical organization data under billing | Reports | 90 days
- specifically here gcp...services is historical but gcp...network is a currently billing project
