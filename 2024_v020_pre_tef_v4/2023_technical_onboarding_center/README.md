# Landing Zone Instructions

## Architecture
### High Level Diagram
<img width="1024" alt="gcp_dual_interconnect_diagram" src="img/gcp_dual_interconnect_diagram.png">

## Prerequisites
- Shared VPC
- admin IAM roles
- Redundant VLAN interconnects are across two edge availability domains - AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_1 AND 2 - see https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/how-to/partner/creating-redundant-vlan-attachments

## Change to GCP project hosting the shared VPC
```
gcloud config set project lz-tls
```
## Clone the repo
```
cd lz-tls
mkdir _interconnect
cd _interconnect/
git clone  https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding.git
root_@cloudshell:~/lz-tls/_interconnect (lz-tls)$ cd ..
```

## Move this folder over to your own landing zone repo

```
  where csr is the original lz and we just cloned the pbmm repo into a new pbmm.. folder

cp -rp _interconnect/pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/2023_technical_onboarding_center/20-partner-interconnect/ pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/environments/nonprod/
cd pbmm-on-gcp-onboarding/environments/nonprod/
```

## Set variables
Navigate to the 20-partner-interconnect folder and edit settings.tfvars if required below 

```
vpc_name = "vpc-nonprod-shared"
region1 = "northamerica-northeast1"
```


## Manual Terraform CLI Option - for those not running CSR
This option can be run as well - out of band - on the existing CSR repo for testing purposes.  However I recommend you move this folder into your current landing zone folder and add/merge the changes into your local CSR repo and let Cloud Build kick in via its triggers.

### Init
```
terraform init
```

### Plan
```
terraform plan --var-file settings.tfvars
```

### Apply

``
terraform apply --var-file settings.tfvars
``


## Automated GitOps via CSR - default Landing Zone option
Move this folder into your current landing zone folder and add/merge the changes into your local CSR repo and let Cloud Build kick in via its triggers.

Let Cloud Build kick in on the non-prod trigger
