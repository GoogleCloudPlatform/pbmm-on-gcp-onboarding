file.

## Purpose

The purpose of this step is to bootstrap a Google Cloud organization, creating all the required resources and permissions to start using the Cloud Foundation Toolkit (CFT). This step also configures a [CI/CD Pipeline](/docs/GLOSSARY.md#foundation-cicd-pipeline) for foundations code in subsequent stages. The [CI/CD Pipeline](/docs/GLOSSARY.md#foundation-cicd-pipeline) can use either Cloud Build and Cloud Source Repos or Jenkins and your own Git repos (which might live on-premises).

## Prerequisites

To run the commands described in this document, install the following:

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) version 393.0.0 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) version 2.28.0 or later
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 1.3.0

**Note:** Make sure that you use version 1.3.0 of Terraform throughout this series. Otherwise, you might experience Terraform state snapshot lock errors.

Also make sure that you've done the following:

1. Set up a Google Cloud
   [organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization).
1. Set up a Google Cloud
   [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account).
1. Create Cloud Identity or Google Workspace groups for
   organization and billing admins.
1. Add the user who will use Terraform to the `group_org_admins` group.
   They must be in this group, or they won't have
   `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` access.
1. For the user who will run the procedures in this document, grant the following roles:
   - The `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` role on the Google Cloud organization.
   - The `roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin` role on the Google Cloud organization.
   - The `roles/billing.admin` role on the billing account.
   - The `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator` role.

If other users need to be able to run these procedures, add them to the group
represented by the `org_project_creators` variable.
For more information about the permissions that are required, and the resources
that are created, see the organization bootstrap module
[documentation.](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-bootstrap)

### Optional - Automatic creation of Google Cloud Identity groups

In the foundation, Google Cloud Identity groups are used for [authentication and access management](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/authentication-authorization) .

To enable automatic creation of the [required groups](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/authentication-authorization#users_and_groups), complete the following actions:

- Have an existing project for Cloud Identity API billing.
- Enable the Cloud Identity API (`cloudidentity.googleapis.com`) on the billing project.
- Grant role `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` to the user running Terraform on the billing project.
- Provide values for the groups and billing project in the variable `groups`.

All groups in the `groups.required_groups` are required.

All groups in the `groups.optional_groups` are optional.

### Optional - Cloud Build access to on-prem

See [onprem](./onprem.md) for instructions on how to configure Cloud Build access to your on-premises environment.

### Troubleshooting

See [troubleshooting](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you run into issues during this step.

## Deploying with Jenkins

If you are using the `jenkins_bootstrap` sub-module, see
[README-Jenkins](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/blob/master/0-bootstrap/README-Jenkins.md)
for requirements and instructions on how to run the 0-bootstrap step. Using
Jenkins requires a few manual steps, including configuring connectivity with
your current Jenkins manager (controller) environment.

## Deploying with Cloud Build

1. Clone [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation) into your local environment and navigate to the `0-bootstrap` folder.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation.git

   cd terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap
   ```

1. Rename `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment:

   ```bash
   mv terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Use the helper script [validate-requirements.sh](../scripts/validate-requirements.sh) to validate your environment:

   ```bash
   ../scripts/validate-requirements.sh -o <ORGANIZATION_ID> -b <BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID> -u <END_USER_EMAIL>
   ```

   **Note:** The script is not able to validate if the user is in a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace group with the required roles.

1. Run `terraform init` and `terraform plan` and review the output.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan -input=false -out bootstrap.tfplan
   ```

1. To  validate your policies, run `gcloud beta terraform vet`. For installation instructions, see [Install Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/validate-policies#install).

1. Run the following commands and check for violations:

   ```bash
   export VET_PROJECT_ID=A-VALID-PROJECT-ID
   terraform show -json bootstrap.tfplan > bootstrap.json
   gcloud beta terraform vet bootstrap.json --policy-library="../policy-library" --project ${VET_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   *`A-VALID-PROJECT-ID`* must be an existing project you have access to. This is necessary because Terraform-validator needs to link resources to a valid Google Cloud Platform project.

1. Run `terraform apply`.

   ```bash
   terraform apply bootstrap.tfplan
   ```

1. Run `terraform output` to get the email address of the terraform service accounts that will be used to run manual steps for `shared` environments in steps `3-networks-dual-svpc`, `3-networks-hub-and-spoke`, and `4-projects` and the state bucket that will be used by step 4-projects.

   ```bash
   export network_step_sa=$(terraform output -raw networks_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   export projects_step_sa=$(terraform output -raw projects_step_terraform_service_account_email)
   export projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate=$(terraform output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)

   echo "network step service account = ${network_step_sa}"
   echo "projects step service account = ${projects_step_sa}"
   echo "projects gcs bucket tfstate = ${projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate}"
   ```

1. Run `terraform output` to get the ID of your Cloud Build project:

   ```bash
   export cloudbuild_project_id=$(terraform output -raw cloudbuild_project_id)
   echo "cloud build project ID = ${cloudbuild_project_id}"
   ```

1. Copy the backend and update `backend.tf` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket for Terraform's state. Also update the `backend.tf` of all steps.

   ```bash
   export backend_bucket=$(terraform output -raw gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "backend_bucket = ${backend_bucket}"

   export backend_bucket_projects=$(terraform output -raw projects_gcs_bucket_tfstate)
   echo "backend_bucket_projects = ${backend_bucket_projects}"

   cp backend.tf.example backend.tf
   cd ..

   for i in `find -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i "s/UPDATE_ME/${backend_bucket}/" $i; done
   for i in `find -name 'backend.tf'`; do sed -i "s/UPDATE_PROJECTS_BACKEND/${backend_bucket_projects}/" $i; done

   cd 0-bootstrap
   ```

1. Re-run `terraform init`. When you're prompted, agree to copy Terraform state to Cloud Storage.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

1. (Optional) Run `terraform plan` to verify that state is configured correctly. You should see no changes from the previous state.
1. Clone the policy repo and copy contents of policy-library to new repo. Clone the repo at the same level of the `terraform-example-foundation` folder.

   ```bash
   cd ../..

   gcloud source repos clone gcp-policies --project=${cloudbuild_project_id}

   cd gcp-policies
   git checkout -b main
   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/policy-library/ .
   ```

1. Commit changes and push your main branch to the policy repo.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize policy library repo'
   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```

1. Navigate out of the repo.

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

1. Save `0-bootstrap` Terraform configuration to `gcp-bootstrap` source repository:

   ```bash
   gcloud source repos clone gcp-bootstrap --project=${cloudbuild_project_id}

   cd gcp-bootstrap
   git checkout -b plan
   mkdir -p envs/shared

   cp -RT ../terraform-example-foundation/0-bootstrap/ ./envs/shared
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* .
   cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/tf-wrapper.sh .
   chmod 755 ./tf-wrapper.sh

   git add .
   git commit -m 'Initialize bootstrap repo'
   git push --set-upstream origin plan
   ```

1. Continue with the instructions in the [1-org](../1-org/README.md) step.

**Note 1:** The stages after `0-bootstrap` use `terraform_remote_state` data source to read common configuration like the organization ID from the output of the `0-bootstrap` stage. They will [fail](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#error-unsupported-attribute) if the state is not copied to the Cloud Storage bucket.

**Note 2:** After the deploy, even if you did not receive the project quota error described in the [Troubleshooting guide](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#project-quota-exceeded), we recommend that you request 50 additional projects for the **projects step service account** created in this step.

## Running Terraform locally

If you deploy using Cloud Build, the bucket information is replaced in the state
backends as part of the build process when the build is executed by Cloud Build.
If you want to execute Terraform locally, you need to add your Cloud
Storage bucket to the `backend.tf` files.
Each step has instructions for this change.
