# This bootstrap script is meant to be run by one elevated user, in one sitting, with the permanent naming convention to be used. 
# CAVEATS - The reason for this is: 
# Permissions for that user are temporary, changing users before the automation takes over operations locks other users out of this process
# Accomplishing this is one sitting allows all users to contribute to repairing any issues in the environment by contributing code
# Project_Ids are globally consistent across all of Google Cloud Platform, projects take 7 days to delete and wont release that unique name until fully deleted.
